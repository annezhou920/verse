                Moon marked and touched by sun
                my magic  is unwritten
                but when the sea turns back
                it will leave my shape behind.
                I seek no favor
                untouched by blood
                unrelenting as the curse of love
                permanent as my errors
                or my pride
                I do not mix
                love with pity
                nor hate with scorn
                and if you would know me
                look into the entrails of Uranus
                where the restless oceans pound.

                I do not dwell
                within my birth nor my divinities
                who am ageless and half-grown
                and still seeking
                my sisters
                witches in Dahomey
                wear me inside their coiled cloths
                as our mother did
                mourning.

                I have been woman
                for a long time
                beware my smile
                I am treacherous with old magic
                and the noon's new fury
                with all your wide futures
                promised
                I am
                woman
                and not white.`

      "verse": `
                As through marble or the lining of
                certain fish split open and scooped
                clean, this is the blue vein
                that rides, where the flesh is even
                whiter than the rest of her, the splayed
                thighs mother forgets, busy struggling
                for command over bones: her own,
                those of the chaise longue, all
                equally uncooperative, and there’s
                the wind, too. This is her hair, gone
                from white to blue in the air.

                This is the black, shot with blue, of my dark
                daddy’s knuckles, that do not change, ever.
                Which is to say they are no more pale
                in anger than at rest, or when, as
                I imagine them now, they follow
                the same two fingers he has always used
                to make the rim of every empty blue
                glass in the house sing.
                Always, the same
                blue-to-black sorrow
                no black surface can entirely hide.

                Under the night, somewhere
                between the white that is nothing so much as
                blue, and the black that is, finally; nothing,
                I am the man neither of you remembers.
                Shielding, in the half-dark,
                the blue eyes I sometimes forget
                I don’t have. Pulling my own stoop-
                shouldered kind of blues across paper.
                Apparently misinformed about the rumored
                stuff of dreams: everywhere I inquired,
                I was told look for blue.`

      "verse": `
              you are a horse running alone
              and he tries to tame you
              compares you to an impossible highway
              to a burning house
              says you are blinding him
              that he could never leave you
              forget you
              want anything but you
              you dizzy him, you are unbearable
              every woman before or after you
              is doused in your name
              you fill his mouth
              his teeth ache with memory of taste
              his body just a long shadow seeking yours
              but you are always too intense
              frightening in the way you want him
              unashamed and sacrificial
              he tells you that no man can live up
              to the one who
              lives in your head
              and you tried to change didn't you?
              closed your mouth more
              tried to be softer
              prettier
              less volatile, less awake
              but even when sleeping you could feel
              him travelling away from you in his dreams
              so what did you want to do love
              split his head open?
              you can't make homes out of human beings
              someone should have already told you that
              and if he wants to leave
              then let him leave
              you are terrifying
              and strange and beautiful
              something not everyone knows how to love.`
